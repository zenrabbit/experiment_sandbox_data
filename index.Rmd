## Designcraft for experiments open data   
A set of remote exercises exploring experimental design for the life sciences. A total of three independent labs were done to focus on different design principles, sampling techniques, and taxa. Exercises are described in full in this open access manual entitled [Designcraft for experiments](https://bookdown.org/chris/designcraft4experiments/). Data were collected by students in a third-year biology course offering at [York University](https://biology.yorku.ca) in Toronto, ON, Canada. Students collected the data and published individual datasets to [figshare](https://figshare.com) with a [CCBY4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) licensing. Data were then compiled for each lab including balcony birdwatching, backyard bioblitz, and solo surveys by M. Zuliani and M. Owen. The provenance of each independent observation in the compiled data was recognized by attribution to the initials of the primary data author.  

Attribution  
CJL designed the experiments.  
Students in course offering collected, innovated, and published individual, primary datasets.  
MZ, MO, and CJL reviewed the compiled data.

Metadata  
Record-level  
year is the calendar year of work not term  
experiment describes the three experimental options in designcraft book  
source is either full experiment or pilot experiment  
rep is the replicate per experimental set  
location is the site name locally  
habitat is the ecological classification  
date is the calendar date for each observation  

Attribute-level  
bioblitz  
taxa is a classification by vertebrate or invertebrate  
species in the genus and species for observation   

birds  
frequency is the number observed within a 3-5min observation interval  
behaviours are described in ethogram  

solo-survey  
vegetation surveys and species_richness is the total number of unique species observed per 0.5 x 0.5m quadrat  
total cover is the total cover of vegetation within the 0.5m quadrat capped at 100
